				<h2>SELF REMINDER</h2>
				<p>Don’t get stuck worrying about what you’ve missed out on, instead, open up your eyes for the new opportunities right in front of you.
                    When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/LjhCEhWiKXk">you're good enough jaska</a>.</p>

				<hr>
                <p>You are the sun that shines brightly throughout my day.
                    You are the gravity that holds me down in every way.
                    You are the moon that shimmers throughout my night.
                    You are stars that glimmer oh so bright</p>

					My lover and best friend jaska,
            We met during a time in my life when I felt hopeless and lost. You reached your hand out to me and lifted me up and helped me see the world through your eyes. You got me to laugh again. You got me to feel love again. You made me feel safe and helped me find myself. Thank you for reminding me I am worth loving. It's been an honor and a pleasure loving you duduy.
